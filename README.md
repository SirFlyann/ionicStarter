# ionicStarter

### Description

Basically, its an Ionic project that has been beautifuly organized (IMHO).It uses the tabs template.

I'm using Browserify to bundle up everything starting from app.js

### Why I did this

Things went south with React Native, I got wrecked by a teacher. 
Not pissed with him, pissed with me. Anyway, I'll show him I can keep his discipline up, while I try for new technologies. 
I really don't want to be just another guy that learns only what he teaches.o
